# Exploratory Work
Throughout the project, we conducted numerous explorations that took a significant amount of time. We want to showcase these efforts here so as not to discard them. Some of the explorations include performance testing, as Python is notoriously slow in calculations (concurrent.ipynb), while others are alternative testing files (diehard_test.py).

These files are still workable, which some of them servers as development tool.
